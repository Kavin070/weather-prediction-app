# Weather Prediction ML Project

A simple machine learning project that predicts weather conditions based on atmospheric parameters.

## Setup

1. Create a new folder for your project
2. Create all the Python files listed above
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Features

- 🤖 Random Forest machine learning model
- 📊 Data visualization and analysis
- 🎯 Interactive weather prediction
- 📈 Feature importance analysis
- 🌤️ Predicts 5 weather conditions: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Clear, Snowy

## Files

- `data_generator.py` - Creates synthetic weather data
- `model.py` - Machine learning model class
- `visualizer.py` - Data visualization functions
- `predictor.py` - Interactive prediction interface
- `main.py` - Main program with menu system

## Example Prediction

Input:
- Temperature: 30°C
- Humidity: 40%
- Pressure: 1020 hPa
- Wind Speed: 3 km/h
- Cloud Cover: 10%

Output: **Sunny** (85% confidence)
```

## Quick Start Instructions:

1. **Create a new folder** in VS Code called `weather_prediction`
2. **Create each file** listed above and copy the respective code
3. **Open terminal** in VS Code and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

This organized structure makes it much easier to:
- Understand each component
- Modify individual parts
- Add new features
- Debug issues
- Follow software engineering best practices
